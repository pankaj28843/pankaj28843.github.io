  <h1>About this space</h1>
  <p>
    I am Pankaj, building software products with a bias for clarity, calm workflows,
    and design that respects attention. This blog is a collection of patterns,
    experiments, and field notes from work in progress.

    Expect a mix of product thinking, engineering trade-offs, and the occasional
    behind-the-scenes look at how I learn. If you would like to collaborate or
    share feedback, reach out on GitHub.

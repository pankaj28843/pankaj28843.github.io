Shipping is a habit. When the release size is small, you can stay close to the
customer signal and make changes without fear. The trick is to pick a cadence
that favors learning over heroics.

A few rules I keep:

- Ship something visible each week, even if it is small.
- Keep a short, written log of what changed and why.
- Celebrate the boring, reliable progress.

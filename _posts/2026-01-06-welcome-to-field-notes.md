This is a living sketchbook for how I work. I am interested in the quiet moments
between idea and execution: where naming, structure, and momentum are chosen.

## Why this journal exists

I wanted a place that captures the practical, human parts of building software.

## How to navigate

- Start with the archive for context.
- Follow tags that match your current focus.
- Expect notes that favor clarity over polish.

In this space you will find short essays, design breakdowns, and experiments
that are still warm. If you are building something thoughtful, I hope this helps.
